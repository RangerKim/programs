<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Identify fossils from the Ordovician period found in Floyds Fork.</li>
  <li>Explain the process of fossilization, including the five main steps: death, burial, decay, mineralization, and discovery.</li>
  <li>Understand preservation bias and why only hard parts often fossilize.</li>

<h2>Key Vocabulary</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Fossil:</strong> The preserved remains, impression, or trace of a once-living organism from the past.</li>
  <li><strong>Fossilization:</strong> The process by which living material is preserved in the rock record.</li>
  <li><strong>Mineralization:</strong> Step in fossilization where minerals replace organic material in the hard parts.</li>
  <li><strong>Preservation Bias:</strong> The tendency for some organisms or parts (like shells or bones) to fossilize more easily than others.</li>
  <li><strong>Ordovician Period:</strong> A geologic time period ~485–443 million years ago, when most life was marine.</li>
  <li><strong>Scientific Illustration:</strong> A drawing based on observation and evidence, often used to depict organisms and habitats.</li>
  <li><strong>Leave No Trace:</strong> Enjoying natural areas responsibly by not removing or damaging plants, animals, rocks, or fossils so others can learn from them.</li>

<tr>
<td>~5</td>
<td>Prior Knowledge Check</td>
<td class="wedo"><span class="label">We Do:</span> Discuss what students know</td>
<td>Ask guiding questions:
<ul>
<li>What do you think fossils are?</li>
<li>How do you think something turns into a fossil?</li>
<li>Do you think all parts of an animal are equally likely to become a fossil?</li>
<li>Why is it important not to remove fossils from nature?</li>
</ul>
Record ideas on the board and note gaps or misconceptions. Emphasize Leave No Trace thinking.</td>

<tr>
<td>~5</td>
<td>Introduce Fossilization Steps</td>
<td class="ido"><span class="label">I Do:</span> Explain key concepts</td>
<td>Discuss the five steps of fossilization with guiding questions:
<ul>
<li>Death: “What might happen when this creature dies in the ocean?”</li>
<li>Burial: “How does sediment cover it?”</li>
<li>Decay: “Which parts decay first?”</li>
<li>Mineralization: “What do you think replaces the bones or shells over time?”</li>
<li>Discovery: “How do we find these fossils millions of years later?”</li>
</ul>
Use diagrams, mention that fossils are fragile and must be handled responsibly if brought in from Floyds Fork or observed on site.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>~6</td>
<td>Observation & Evidence Discussion</td>
<td class="wedo"><span class="label">We Do:</span> Analyze fossils</td>
<td>Show fossils. Ask:
<ul>
<li>Which parts are present? Missing?</li>
<li>Why do you think only these parts are preserved?</li>
<li>What can we infer about the creature’s size, shape, or lifestyle?</li>
<li>How can we handle these fossils so they aren’t damaged for future learners?</li>
</ul>
Draw observations on the board to build a shared model. Demonstrate gentle handling and Leave No Trace principles.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>~10</td>
<td>Scientific Illustrator Group Modeling</td>
<td class="wedo"><span class="label">We Do:</span> Predict & model environment</td>
<td>Ask students to describe what might have surrounded their fossil in the Ordovician sea:
<ul>
<li>What kind of water, plants, or other animals might have been nearby?</li>
<li>Where would it have rested or moved?</li>
<li>How can we model this without touching or taking fossils from nature?</li>
</ul>
Draw ideas on the board to make a shared model. Emphasize evidence-based reasoning and Leave No Trace thinking.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>~15</td>
<td>Group Scientific Illustration</td>
<td class="youdo"><span class="label">You Do:</span> Students draw</td>
<td>Students work in small groups to create an illustration of their Ordovician creature and habitat. Remind them to:
<ul>
<li>Use the fossil as a base.</li>
<li>Fill in missing parts using evidence and imagination.</li>
<li>Consider adaptations for survival.</li>
<li>Handle any fossil materials carefully; do not remove from the park.</li>
</ul>
Circulate to guide reasoning and ensure Leave No Trace principles are followed.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>~10</td>
<td>Group Presentations</td>
<td class="youdo"><span class="label">You Do:</span> Share & explain</td>
<td>Groups present illustrations. Ask:
<ul>
<li>What did you infer about missing parts?</li>
<li>How did you decide what environment or other organisms to include?</li>
<li>If higher level, discuss adaptations.</li>
<li>How did you ensure you followed Leave No Trace rules?</li>
</ul>
Encourage discussion and peer feedback.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>~5</td>
<td>Reflection & Wrap-Up</td>
<td class="wedo"><span class="label">We Do:</span> Summarize learning</td>
<td>Ask students: “What surprised you about fossils? What did you have to infer?” Review vocabulary: fossilization, mineralization, preservation bias, adaptations. Emphasize Leave No Trace and caring for Floyds Fork resources.</td>

<!-- Educator Cheat Sheet -->
<div class="ranger-section">
<h2>Educator Cheat Sheet</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Fossil Examples:</strong> Brachiopods, trilobites, bryozoans, crinoid stems.</li>
  <li><strong>Fossilization Reminders:</strong> Only hard parts are usually preserved; soft tissues decay. Encourage prediction and imagination.</li>
  <li><strong>Guiding Questions:</strong> Ask students to justify why certain features are likely or unlikely.</li>
  <li><strong>Ordovician Environment:</strong> Shallow seas with diverse marine life. Prompt discussion of reefs, predators, and sediment.</li>
  <li><strong>Adaptation Tip:</strong> Ask: “How might this creature move, feed, or avoid predators?”</li>
  <li><strong>Leave No Trace & Fossil Care:</strong> Fossils are fragile and non-renewable. Handle gently or observe without touching. Never remove fossils from Floyds Fork so others can learn from them. Reinforce this throughout activities.</li>
</ul>
</div>
  <h2>Deeper Educator Knowledge</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Ordovician Geology:</strong> Floyds Fork sediments are primarily limestone and shale formed in a shallow sea environment. Understanding sediment deposition helps explain fossil preservation.</li>
  <li><strong>Fossilization Process:</strong> Beyond the five main steps, educators can explore permineralization, recrystallization, and molds/casts in detail.</li>
  <li><strong>Preservation Bias:</strong> Soft-bodied organisms rarely fossilize. Discuss why this affects our view of ancient ecosystems.</li>
  <li><strong>Ordovician Biodiversity:</strong> Study reef-building organisms, early cephalopods, and plankton to explain community structure.</li>
  <li><strong>Local Paleoecology:</strong> Consider predator-prey interactions, mobility, and feeding strategies of Ordovician marine life.</li>
  <li><strong>Scientific Illustration Tips:</strong> Techniques for reconstructing missing parts using symmetry, functional morphology, and comparisons with related organisms.</li>
  <li><strong>Leave No Trace Science Connection:</strong> Understanding the fragility and non-renewable nature of fossils strengthens the rationale for careful handling and conservation ethics.</li>
