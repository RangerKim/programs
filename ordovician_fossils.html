<h1>Lesson Plan: Ordovician Fossils at Floyds Fork</h1>

<p><strong>Grade Level:</strong> Upper Elementary<br>
<strong>Duration:</strong> ~60 minutes<br>
<strong>Location:</strong> Classroom / Floyds Fork connection<br>
<strong>Instructors:</strong> Educators (___ & ___)</p>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Identify fossils from the Ordovician period found in Floyds Fork.</li>
  <li>Explain the process of fossilization, including the five main steps: death, burial, decay, mineralization, and discovery.</li>
  <li>Understand preservation bias and why only hard parts often fossilize.</li>
  <li>Use evidence and reasoning to reconstruct missing parts of fossils in illustrations.</li>
  <li>Work collaboratively to create a scientific illustration that models an Ordovician sea creature in its environment, connected to Floyds Fork.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Vocabulary</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Fossil:</strong> The preserved remains, impression, or trace of a once-living organism from the past.</li>
  <li><strong>Fossilization:</strong> The process by which living material is preserved in the rock record.</li>
  <li><strong>Mineralization:</strong> Step in fossilization where minerals replace organic material in the hard parts.</li>
  <li><strong>Preservation Bias:</strong> The tendency for some organisms or parts (like shells or bones) to fossilize more easily than others.</li>
  <li><strong>Ordovician Period:</strong> A geologic time period ~485–443 million years ago, when most life was marine.</li>
  <li><strong>Scientific Illustration:</strong> A drawing based on observation and evidence, often used to depict organisms and habitats.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Materials</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Fossils from Floyds Fork (or high-quality replicas/photos)</li>
  <li>Whiteboard or chart paper</li>
  <li>Markers, pencils, and crayons</li>
  <li>Paper for group illustrations</li>
  <li>Optional: reference images of Ordovician sea life</li>
</ul>

<tr>
<td>~3</td>
<td>Student Arrival & Introduction</td>
<td class="ido"><span class="label">I Do:</span> Set expectations</td>
<td>Welcome students, introduce fossils and the Ordovician period. Ask: “Has anyone ever seen a fossil before?” Then connect to Floyds Fork: “Some of the fossils we study come from Floyds Fork. What clues about the land or streams might help preserve fossils?”</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>~5</td>
<td>Prior Knowledge Check</td>
<td class="wedo"><span class="label">We Do:</span> Discuss what students know</td>
<td>Ask guiding questions:
<ul>
<li>What do you think fossils are?</li>
<li>How do you think something turns into a fossil?</li>
<li>Do you think all parts of an animal are equally likely to become a fossil?</li>
<li>If you explored Floyds Fork today, what might you find that could become a fossil?</li>
</ul>
Record ideas on the board, noting misconceptions to address later.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>~5</td>
<td>Introduce Fossilization Steps</td>
<td class="ido"><span class="label">I Do:</span> Explain key concepts</td>
<td>Discuss the five steps of fossilization using guiding questions:
<ul>
<li>Death: “What might happen when this creature dies in the ocean?”</li>
<li>Burial: “How does sediment cover it?”</li>
<li>Decay: “Which parts decay first?”</li>
<li>Mineralization: “What replaces bones or shells over time?”</li>
<li>Discovery: “How do we find fossils millions of years later?”</li>
</ul>
Use diagrams and ask students to connect sediment/rock layers to Floyds Fork.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>~6</td>
<td>Observation & Evidence Discussion</td>
<td class="wedo"><span class="label">We Do:</span> Analyze fossils</td>
<td>Show fossils from Floyds Fork. Ask:
<ul>
<li>Which parts are present? Which are missing?</li>
<li>Why do you think only these parts are preserved? (Preservation bias)</li>
<li>What can we infer about the creature’s size, shape, or lifestyle?</li>
</ul>
Draw observations on the board to create a shared fossil model. Prompt students to justify reasoning.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>~10</td>
<td>Scientific Illustrator Group Modeling</td>
<td class="wedo"><span class="label">We Do:</span> Predict & model environment</td>
<td>Ask students to imagine what surrounded their fossil in the Ordovician sea and how that relates to Floyds Fork:
<ul>
<li>What kind of water, plants, or animals might have been nearby?</li>
<li>Where would the creature have rested or moved?</li>
<li>Draw their ideas on the board, creating a model of the creature and its habitat together.</li>
</ul>
Prompt reasoning: “Which parts are based on fossil evidence, and which are inference?” Encourage comparisons to modern Floyds Fork streams and habitats.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>~15</td>
<td>Group Scientific Illustration</td>
<td class="youdo"><span class="label">You Do:</span> Students draw</td>
<td>Students work in small groups to illustrate their Ordovician creature and environment:
<ul>
<li>Use the fossil as a base.</li>
<li>Fill in missing parts using evidence and imagination.</li>
<li>Consider adaptations for movement, feeding, or survival.</li>
<li>Encourage connections to modern Floyds Fork: “How does our park today differ from the Ordovician sea?”</li>
</ul>
Circulate and ask guiding questions, prompting evidence-based reasoning.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>~10</td>
<td>Group Presentations</td>
<td class="youdo"><span class="label">You Do:</span> Share & explain</td>
<td>Groups present their illustrations. Ask:
<ul>
<li>What did you infer about missing parts?</li>
<li>How did you decide what environment or other organisms to include?</li>
<li>How might these adaptations help the creature survive?</li>
<li>How does your Ordovician sea compare to Floyds Fork today?</li>
</ul>
Encourage peer discussion and constructive feedback.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>~5</td>
<td>Reflection & Wrap-Up</td>
<td class="wedo"><span class="label">We Do:</span> Summarize learning</td>
<td>Ask students: “What surprised you about fossils? What did you have to infer?” Highlight vocabulary: fossilization, mineralization, preservation bias, adaptations, and connections to Floyds Fork.</td>
</tr>

<h2>Assessment / Look-Fors</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Participation:</strong> Students actively contribute to discussions, predictions, and drawings.</li>
<li><strong>Evidence-Based Reasoning:</strong> Students justify inferences about missing parts and habitat using fossil evidence.</li>
<li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Students work together to create a coherent scientific illustration.</li>
<li><strong>Adaptation Thinking:</strong> Higher-level students explain possible adaptations for survival.</li>
<li><strong>Connection to Floyds Fork:</strong> Students relate fossils to local parklands and streams.</li>
<li><strong>Presentation Skills:</strong> Students clearly describe their reconstructed creature and habitat.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Observation Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ensure students connect fossil evidence to their inferences.</li>
<li>Check that students distinguish between observed evidence vs. imaginative reconstruction.</li>
<li>Observe group discussion, reasoning, and vocabulary usage.</li>
<li>Look for engagement with both fossils and the broader Ordovician environment.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Color coding <span class="ido">I Do (Green)</span>, <span class="wedo">We Do (Yellow)</span>, <span class="youdo">You Do (Blue)</span> is for quick visual reference for educators during facilitation and observation.</p>

<div class="ranger-section">
<h2>Educator Cheat Sheet</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Fossil Examples:</strong> Brachiopods, trilobites, bryozoans, crinoid stems.</li>
  <li><strong>Fossilization Reminders:</strong> Only hard parts are usually preserved; soft tissues decay. Encourage prediction and imagination.</li>
  <li><strong>Guiding Questions:</strong> Ask students to justify why certain features are likely or unlikely.</li>
  <li><strong>Ordovician Environment:</strong> Shallow seas with diverse marine life. Prompt discussion of reefs, predators, and sediment.</li>
  <li><strong>Adaptation Tip:</strong> Ask: “How might this creature move, feed, or avoid predators?”</li>
  <li><strong>Floyds Fork Connection:</strong> Always bring students back to the parklands. Compare Ordovician environments to the streams, rocks, and habitats they see today.</li>
