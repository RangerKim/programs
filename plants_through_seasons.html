<h1>Lesson Plan: Seasons Explorers – Floyds Fork Parklands</h1>

<p><strong>Grade Level:</strong> Elementary (adaptable for K–5)<br>
<strong>Duration:</strong> ~60 minutes<br>
<strong>Location:</strong> Classroom / optional outdoor visit to Floyds Fork parklands<br>
<strong>Instructors:</strong> Rangers</p>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Describe how plants change during the seasons using a physical, movement-based model.</li>
  <li>Identify seasonal patterns (spring, summer, fall, winter) and relate them to plant cycles.</li>
  <li>Explain how environmental factors (day length, temperature, sunlight) affect plant growth, bloom, dormancy, and “tired/stressed” states.</li>
  <li>Connect observations of seasonal cycles to real-life examples in Floyds Fork, including actively farmed areas.</li>
  <li>Optional higher-level: Connect seasonal changes to solstices and Kentucky growing season.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Vocabulary</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter</strong> – The four seasons with distinct patterns of daylight and temperature.</li>
  <li><strong>Sprout</strong> – When a plant begins to grow from a seed, typically in spring.</li>
  <li><strong>Bud</strong> – Small unopened leaf or flower developing in late spring.</li>
  <li><strong>Grow</strong> – Stretching, developing, or putting energy into building leaves, stems, and roots. <em>Repeated 10 times in the relay.</em></li>
  <li><strong>Bloom</strong> – Opening of flowers in summer. Controlled so plants do not touch each other.</li>
  <li><strong>Fruit</strong> – Ripening of seeds or produce, usually in late summer or fall.</li>
  <li><strong>Dormant</strong> – Resting phase in winter when plants conserve energy.</li>
  <li><strong>Tired / Stressed</strong> – When plants overextend growth, bloom too early, get too much sun, or have shortened dormancy. “Tired” is used for younger students; stressed is the scientific term.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Materials</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Open space for relay</li>
  <li>Cones or markers for start/finish</li>
  <li>Batons (or small objects) for passing</li>
  <li>Optional photos of Floyds Fork parklands in each season</li>
  <li>Whiteboard/chart paper for discussion prompts</li>
</ul>

<td>Vocabulary Introduction</td>
<td class="ido"><span class="label">I Do:</span></td>
<td>Introduce season-related vocabulary (sprout, bud, grow, bloom, fruit, dormant, tired/stressed). Give examples from Floyds Fork or local farms.</td>

<td>Plant Cycle Relay Game</td>
<td class="youdo"><span class="label">You Do:</span></td>
<td>
Students form teams and run a relay representing a plant’s seasonal cycle. Each step must be acted out physically before passing the baton. Movements include:

<ol>
<li><strong>Sprout (Spring)</strong> – Slowly rise like a shoot. Fingers wiggle like leaves. Students can invent gestures.</li>
<li><strong>Bud (Late Spring)</strong> – Form a fist or curl hands to show buds.</li>
<li><strong>Grow (Spring/Summer, Repeat 10 Times)</strong> – Stretch and bend 10 times to show energy-intensive growth.</li>
<li><strong>Bloom (Summer, Controlled)</strong> – Open arms, sway, or spin gently without touching others.</li>
<li><strong>Fruit (Late Summer/Fall)</strong> – Hug self or hold hands overhead for 10 seconds to show ripening.</li>
<li><strong>Dormant (Winter)</strong> – Crouch or freeze to represent resting phase until your team is completely quiet and back where they started to get ready to do the process again .</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Variation Tie-In:</strong> Students naturally perform steps differently, just like real plants. Discuss:  
<ul>
<li>Which “racers” grew faster or slower? Why?</li>
<li>How might early bloomers or fast growers compete for sunlight, water, or nutrients at Floyds Fork?</li>
<li>How does season length affect plant energy and “tired/stressed” states?</li>
<li>How can overexertion (too much growth, too long bloom, too much sun) cause stress?</li>
</ul>

Optional: Extra rounds to simulate shortened dormancy or extended growth. Students notice which plants get tired faster, connecting to seasonal changes and climate effects.</p>

<td>Reflection & Discussion</td>
<td class="wedo"><span class="label">We Do:</span></td>
<td>Ask guiding questions at each step:  
<ul>
<li>“Which movements were easiest or hardest? Why?”</li>
<li>“How does this relate to what we see at Floyds Fork during each season?”</li>
<li>“What happens if winter is too short or summer too long?”</li>
<li>“How does variation among plants affect the ecosystem?”</li>
</ul></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>~4</td>
<td>Optional Outdoor Observation (if time)</td>
<td class="youdo"><span class="label">You Do:</span></td>
<td>Walk students around Floyds Fork to observe seasonal changes, buds, blooms, dormant plants, or active farmed fields. Ask: “Can you see the stages or energy use we acted out?”</td>

<h2>Assessment / Look-Fors</h2>
<ul>
<li>Participation in relay and discussion.</li>
<li>Ability to connect plant movements to seasonal changes.</li>
<li>Explanation of “tired/stressed” plants and causes.</li>
<li>Observational connections to Floyds Fork seasons and farmed areas.</li>
<li>Optional: Ability to discuss solstice timing and seasonal light cues for older students.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Observation Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Guide discussion with leading questions at each step.</li>
<li>Ensure grow is repeated 10 times, bloom is controlled.</li>
<li>Prompt students to notice variation among plant “racers.”</li>
<li>Connect reflections back to Floyds Fork’s seasonal cycles and climate effects.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note"><strong>Cheat Sheet for Rangers:</strong> “Tired” is an accessible way to describe plant stress from too much or too little growth, sunlight, or dormancy. Always tie activities to seasons: sprout → spring, bud → late spring, grow → spring/summer, bloom → summer, fruit → late summer/fall, dormant → winter. Variation among plants mirrors real plant diversity, competition, and resource use. Use Floyds Fork parklands, including still-farmed areas, for concrete examples.</p>

<div class="ranger-section">
<h2>Ranger Deep Dive / Optional Higher-Level</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plant Variation:</strong> Some racers grow or bloom faster/slower. Early bloomers may outcompete slower plants, showing competition for sunlight, water, and nutrients. Overexertion or shortened dormancy causes “tired” plants, impacting seasonal survival.</li>
<li><strong>Seasonal Timing:</strong> Use the relay to show why timing matters: too early bloom, too long growth, or skipped dormancy stresses plants.</li>
<li><strong>Solstices & Kentucky Growing Season:</strong> 
  <ul>
    <li>Winter Solstice: shortest day → plants have less sunlight, reinforcing dormancy.</li>
    <li>Summer Solstice: longest day → maximum sunlight for growth and bloom.</li>
    <li>Kentucky growing season: typically mid-April to October. Students can observe active crops at Floyds Fork.</li>
    <li>Discussion: How shorter winters or longer summers affect plant cycles, energy, and competition.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Park Connection:</strong> Always tie back to Floyds Fork parklands. Show how seasonal changes in sunlight, temperature, and farmed fields demonstrate the same cycles acted out in the relay.</li>
<li><strong>Discussion Prompts:</strong> Which racers were fastest/slower? Did any get “tired”? How does this mirror plant stress or competition in real ecosystems?</li>
</ul>
