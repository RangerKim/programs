<h1>Lesson Plan: Electricity Explorers</h1>

<p><strong>Grade Level:</strong> Upper Elementary<br>
<strong>Duration:</strong> ~60 minutes<br>
<strong>Location:</strong> Classroom / Floyds Fork connection<br>
<strong>Instructors:</strong> Rangers (Erin & Lori)</p>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Observe and describe <strong>electricity</strong> in different forms, including static and current electricity, using hands-on stations.</li>
  <li>Identify and compare <strong>conductors</strong> and <strong>insulators</strong>, and relate energy transfer to natural phenomena in Floyds Fork.</li>
  <li>Apply the <strong>scientific method</strong> to explore electricity and discuss real-world applications, including lightning in the park.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Vocabulary</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Insulator</strong> – A material that does not easily allow electricity to flow through it (e.g., rubber, wood, plastic).</li>
  <li><strong>Conductor</strong> – A material that allows electricity to flow easily (e.g., metals like aluminum, copper, or steel).</li>
  <li><strong>Static electricity</strong> – The buildup of electrical charge on a surface that does not move through a circuit.</li>
  <li><strong>Current electricity</strong> – The flow of electrical charge through a circuit or system.</li>
  <li><strong>Attract</strong> – To pull toward; opposite charges attract.</li>
  <li><strong>Repel</strong> – To push away; like charges repel.</li>
  <li><strong>Potential energy</strong> – Stored energy ready to do work (e.g., charged balloon).</li>
  <li><strong>Kinetic energy</strong> – Energy in motion (e.g., moving balloon or soda can).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Materials</h2>
<ul>
  <li>4 PVC pipes</li>
  <li>3 balloons</li>
  <li>2 beakers</li>
  <li>2 shallow containers</li>
  <li>String</li>
  <li>Salt and pepper mixture</li>
  <li>Paper plates</li>
  <li>Empty soda can</li>
  <li>Rubber ball</li>
  <li>Photos of lightning and electrical phenomena from Floyds Fork</li>
  <li>6 cotton/natural fiber towels</li>
  <li>Dry erase markers</li>
</ul>

<tr>
<td>~2</td>
<td>Student Arrival</td>
<td class="ido"><span class="label">I Do:</span> Greet and set expectations</td>
<td>Welcome students warmly, take attendance, give a brief preview of today’s lesson. Encourage curiosity and excitement about electricity.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>~4</td>
<td>Check Prior Knowledge</td>
<td class="wedo"><span class="label">We Do:</span> Explore existing ideas</td>
<td>Ask: “What do you already know about electricity? Have you seen it in nature or in your home?” Record answers. Prompt: “Have you seen lightning, static shocks, or magnets?” This helps guide station discussions later.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>~5</td>
<td>Introduction to Electricity Concepts</td>
<td class="ido"><span class="label">I Do:</span> Teach key concepts</td>
<td>Introduce vocabulary: conductor, insulator, static and current electricity, attract/repel, potential vs kinetic energy. Use simple examples from home or the park. Ranger tip: highlight **natural electricity in the park** (lightning scars on trees, lightning rod tree in Woodland Gardens, photos of storms).</td>
</tr>

<td>Ranger Setup for Stations</td>
<td class="ido"><span class="label">I Do:</span> Prepare for hands-on activities</td>
<td>One ranger begins explaining concepts while the second ranger sets up stations: PVC pipes, balloons, water, salt & pepper, soda cans, etc. Ensure each station has instructions for students to follow the **scientific method** steps (Question, Hypothesis, Experiment, Observation, Conclusion).</td>

<td class="youdo"><span class="label">You Do:</span> Student hands-on investigation</td>
<td>
<ol>
<li><strong>Station 1: Balloon Dance</strong> – Charge balloons with cloth. Ask students: What happens when balloons come close? Is it attraction or repulsion? Static or current? Ranger tip: Remind students to use **potential and kinetic energy** terms. Discuss real-life observations in the park (sticks, metal signs as conductors/insulators).</li>
<li><strong>Station 2: Dancing Water</strong> – Use charged PVC pipe near water stream. Ask: What happens? Hypothesize why water moves. Static or current? Discuss **attraction and repulsion**. Ranger note: relate to how lightning can affect water and wet surfaces in the park.</li>
<li><strong>Station 3: Salt & Pepper</strong> – Use charged balloon to separate mixture. Ask: Why are some particles attracted more than others? Static or current? Introduce idea of **conductors vs insulators** (students might suggest metal objects, rubber, etc.). Ranger tip: show examples in the park like metal signs, trees, or rocks.</li>
<li><strong>Station 4: Can and Ball</strong> – Move can and rubber ball without touching using charged PVC pipe. Which moves more? Discuss attraction/repulsion, static vs current. Ranger tip: reference lightning rod tree in Woodland Gardens protecting a large oak; explain that conductors help redirect energy safely.</li>
<li><strong>Station 5: Sticky Balloon</strong> – Test which surfaces attract charged balloon. Discuss conductors vs insulators. Ranger note: relate to natural park materials (trees, rocks, soil, metal fences).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Ranger Support Tips:</strong> Move between stations to help students **apply the scientific method**: guide them to ask questions, make predictions, observe carefully, and conclude. Encourage discussions about how this relates to real phenomena in Floyds Fork (lightning scars, storm safety, electricity in trees, or man-made lightning rods).</p>

<tr>
<td>~5</td>
<td>Wrap-Up Discussion</td>
<td class="wedo"><span class="label">We Do:</span> Review & reflect</td>
<td>Ask: “What did you learn about electricity? Where did you see it in the park? How did conductors and insulators behave?” Discuss connections to scientific method, energy transfer, and natural phenomena. Reinforce vocabulary: static vs current, conductors/insulators, attract/repel, potential/kinetic energy.</td>

<h2>Assessment / Look-Fors</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Participation:</strong> Students actively engage with stations and discussions.</li>
<li><strong>Scientific Method:</strong> Students follow the steps (Question, Hypothesis, Experiment, Observation, Conclusion) at each station.</li>
<li><strong>Vocabulary Understanding:</strong> Correctly define conductors, insulators, static/current electricity, attract/repel.</li>
<li><strong>Connections to Floyds Fork:</strong> Students identify lightning scars, lightning rod tree, or other electrical phenomena.</li>
<li><strong>Observation & Reasoning:</strong> Students explain results and predict outcomes using concepts of energy and electricity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Observation Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ensure I Do / We Do / You Do color coding is clear.</li>
<li>Watch for students making connections to the park and real-world electricity.</li>
<li>Observe students using scientific method steps in each station.</li>
<li>Prompt students to discuss observations using key vocabulary.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note"><strong>Cheat Sheet for Rangers:</strong> Conductors allow electricity flow (metal objects, water, wet soil); insulators block it (rubber, plastic, dry wood, cotton). Natural electricity examples in Floyds Fork: lightning strikes, lightning scars on trees, water in streams during storms. The Woodland Gardens oak has a lightning rod for protection. Encourage students to relate stations to these real phenomena.</p>
