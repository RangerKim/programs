<h1>Lesson Plan: Electricity Explorers</h1>

<p><strong>Grade Level:</strong> Upper Elementary<br>
<strong>Duration:</strong> ~60 minutes<br>
<strong>Location:</strong> Classroom / Floyds Fork connection<br>
<strong>Instructors:</strong> Rangers (Erin & Lori)</p>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Observe and explain the behavior of static and current electricity in various systems.</li>
  <li>Identify conductors and insulators and describe how energy moves through a system.</li>
  <li>Apply the scientific method to test hypotheses about electricity through hands-on stations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Vocabulary</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Insulator</strong> – A material that does not allow electricity to flow easily.</li>
  <li><strong>Conductor</strong> – A material that allows electricity to flow easily.</li>
  <li><strong>Static electricity</strong> – The buildup of electric charge on a surface, often resulting in attraction or repulsion.</li>
  <li><strong>Current electricity</strong> – The flow of electric charge through a circuit or conductor.</li>
  <li><strong>Attract / Repel</strong> – Forces that pull objects together or push them apart.</li>
  <li><strong>Potential vs. Kinetic Energy</strong> – Stored energy versus energy in motion.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Materials</h2>
<ul>
  <li>4 PVC pipes</li>
  <li>3 balloons</li>
  <li>2 beakers</li>
  <li>2 shallow containers</li>
  <li>String</li>
  <li>Salt and pepper mixture</li>
  <li>Paper plates</li>
  <li>Empty soda can</li>
  <li>Rubber ball</li>
  <li>Pictures of lightning and Floyds Fork park photos</li>
  <li>6 cotton or natural fiber towels</li>
  <li>Dry erase markers</li>
</ul>

Ask students what they already know about electricity and energy. Encourage sharing:
<ul>
<li>Have you seen sparks, lightning, or objects sticking together?</li>
<li>What do you think makes things attract or repel?</li>
<li>Do you know the difference between static and current electricity?</li>
</ul>
Ask students what questions they have about electricity. Record responses on the board.

<td class="youdo"><span class="label">You Do:</span> Hands-on exploration</td>

Students rotate through stations applying the scientific method. Rangers circulate to guide observations, questions, and reasoning.
<ul>
<li><strong>Station 1 – Balloon Dance:</strong> Charge balloons with cloth. Predict: what will happen when balloons are brought close together? Observe attraction or repulsion. Identify static or current electricity. Record findings.</li>
<li><strong>Station 2 – Dancing Water:</strong> Slowly pour water. Charge PVC pipe and hold near stream. Predict how water moves. Observe, record, and identify electricity type. Discuss observations with a partner.</li>
<li><strong>Station 3 – Salt & Pepper:</strong> Hold charged balloon near mixture. Predict which particles will move first. Observe separation. Determine which is attracted most and discuss why.</li>
<li><strong>Station 4 – Can & Ball:</strong> Use charged PVC pipe to move can and ball without touching. Predict which moves and why. Identify forces: attract or repel. Determine static or current electricity.</li>
<li><strong>Station 5 – Sticky Balloon:</strong> Charge balloon and test surfaces around the room. Predict which objects will stick. Observe and record outcomes. Discuss observations as a group.</li>
</ul>
<span class="note">Ranger 2 ensures all materials are ready at each station and helps students safely and effectively rotate through them.</span>

<td>Wrap-Up & Reflection</td>
<td class="wedo"><span class="label">We Do:</span> Review findings</td>
<td>Discuss what students learned at each station. Ask guiding questions:
<ul>
<li>Which stations showed static electricity versus current electricity?</li>
<li>How did the material type affect movement of objects?</li>
<li>How can we see these concepts in nature or in the park? (e.g., lightning, charged objects)</li>
<li>What surprised you? What did you enjoy the most?</li>
</ul>
Rangers help students make connections to real-world observations and reinforce vocabulary.

<h2>Assessment / Look-Fors</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Participation:</strong> Students actively engage in station activities and discussions.</li>
<li><strong>Scientific Method Use:</strong> Students make predictions, observe carefully, and draw conclusions.</li>
<li><strong>Vocabulary Understanding:</strong> Correctly define and use electricity-related terms.</li>
<li><strong>Connections:</strong> Students relate electricity to real-life examples, including the parklands.</li>
<li><strong>Questioning & Thinking:</strong> Students ask questions and reason through observations at each station.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Observation Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Check that each activity clearly shows I Do / We Do / You Do roles.</li>
<li>Look for students connecting concepts to natural phenomena.</li>
<li>Observe engagement, reasoning, and ability to follow the scientific method.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Color coding I Do (Green), We Do (Yellow), You Do (Blue) is for quick visual reference for rangers during facilitation. Labels in text clearly indicate the type of activity.</p>
