<h1>Lesson Plan: Electricity Explorers</h1>

<p><strong>Grade Level:</strong> Upper Elementary<br>
<strong>Duration:</strong> ~60 minutes<br>
<strong>Location:</strong> Classroom / Floyds Fork connection<br>
<strong>Instructors:</strong> Rangers (Erin & Lori)</p>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<ul>
<li>Observe and experiment with static and current electricity in simple systems.</li>
<li>Use important vocabulary (insulator, conductor, attract, repel, potential vs kinetic energy) to explain electrical behavior.</li>
<li>Apply the scientific method: ask questions, make predictions, test, observe, and draw conclusions, connecting to natural phenomena in Floyds Fork.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Vocabulary</h2>
<ul>
<li>Insulator – A material that does not allow electricity to pass through easily (e.g., rubber, wood).</li>
<li>Conductor – A material that allows electricity to pass through easily (e.g., metal, water).</li>
<li>Static electricity – Electric charge that builds up on the surface of an object and can cause attraction or repulsion.</li>
<li>Current electricity – Flow of electric charge through a conductor, like in a battery or wire.</li>
<li>Attract – When two objects pull toward each other.</li>
<li>Repel – When two objects push away from each other.</li>
<li>Potential energy – Stored energy an object has due to position or charge.</li>
<li>Kinetic energy – Energy of motion.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Materials</h2>
<ul>
<li>4 PVC pipes</li>
<li>3 balloons</li>
<li>2 beakers</li>
<li>2 shallow containers</li>
<li>String</li>
<li>Salt & pepper mixture</li>
<li>Paper plates</li>
<li>Empty soda can</li>
<li>Rubber ball</li>
<li>Pictures of lightning and natural phenomena from Floyds Fork</li>
<li>6 cotton/natural fiber towels</li>
<li>Dry erase markers</li>
</ul>

<tr>
<td>~2</td>
<td>Student Arrival</td>
<td>I Do: Greet and set expectations</td>
<td>Welcome students, take attendance, preview the lesson. Ranger 2 sets up the first stations while Ranger 1 starts introductions. Cue students to settle and organize groups.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>~3</td>
<td>Introduction to Electricity</td>
<td>I Do: Introduce concepts</td>
<td>Explain static vs current electricity, conductors vs insulators, attraction vs repulsion. Show lightning photos and discuss natural examples from Floyds Fork. Prompt: “Have you ever seen sparks or hair standing up? What do you think is happening?” Ranger 2 finishes station setup quietly.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>~4</td>
<td>Vocabulary & Scientific Method</td>
<td>We Do: Guided discussion</td>
<td>Review key vocabulary. Introduce the scientific method steps: Ask, Hypothesize, Experiment, Observe, Conclude. Prompt: “Let’s make a hypothesis: what will happen if we bring a charged balloon near water?” Ranger 2 checks all materials and posts instructions at stations.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>~2</td>
<td>Station Introduction</td>
<td>I Do: Model expectations</td>
<td>Show students one station (e.g., Balloon Dance) and model how to follow the scientific method: make a prediction, test, observe, record, and conclude. Discuss safety rules. Ranger 2 ensures other stations are ready.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>~25</td>
<td>Electricity Stations Rotations</td>
<td>You Do: Student exploration</td>
<td>
Students rotate through the 5 stations. Rangers circulate to guide and prompt reasoning:
<ul>
<li><strong>Station 1 – Balloon Dance:</strong> Charge balloons with cloth. Predict attraction/repulsion. Observe results. Ask: “What type of electricity is this?” “Why did the balloons move the way they did?”</li>
<li><strong>Station 2 – Dancing Water:</strong> Pour water into beaker slowly. Bring charged PVC near stream. Predict, observe, and record. Questions: “Is this attraction or repulsion?” “Why does water respond?”</li>
<li><strong>Station 3 – Salt & Pepper:</strong> Hold charged balloon near mixture. Predict which particles move. Observe and record. Prompt: “Why do some particles respond more than others?” “Static or current electricity?”</li>
<li><strong>Station 4 – Can & Ball:</strong> Use charged PVC to move can or rubber ball. Predict, observe, and record. Discuss: “Which moved first? Why? Potential or kinetic energy?”</li>
<li><strong>Station 5 – Sticky Balloon:</strong> Charge balloon, test which surfaces it sticks to. Predict, observe, record. Prompt: “Why did it stick to some surfaces but not others?” “Which materials are conductors or insulators?”</li>
</ul>
Rangers give 3-minute warnings for transitions, ask guided discovery questions, and check that all students are applying the scientific method at each step.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>~10</td>
<td>Group Wrap-Up Discussion</td>
<td>We Do: Reflection & connection</td>
<td>Ask: “Which experiment surprised you most?” “How did your observations match your predictions?” “How can we see electricity in nature, like in Floyds Fork?” Ranger 2 ensures students articulate conclusions and connects concepts to real-world energy examples.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>~5</td>
<td>Clean-Up & Reflection</td>
<td>You Do: Student reflection</td>
<td>Students return materials, clean stations. Rangers ask: “If you were a scientist, what would you try next?” Emphasize curiosity, observations, and linking experiments to nature. Rangers praise teamwork and scientific thinking.</td>

<h2>Assessment / Look-Fors</h2>
<ul>
<li>Participation: Students actively engage in stations and discussions.</li>
<li>Scientific Method Understanding: Students ask questions, make hypotheses, observe, and conclude.</li>
<li>Vocabulary Use: Correct use of insulator, conductor, static electricity, attract, repel, potential and kinetic energy.</li>
<li>Observation Skills: Students notice and record effects of static electricity and energy transfer.</li>
<li>Connections to Floyds Fork: Students link experiments to natural phenomena in the park.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Observation Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Prompt students to explain attraction/repulsion using vocabulary.</li>
<li>Check that each station clearly follows scientific method steps.</li>
<li>Observe curiosity, reasoning, and connection to nature.</li>
<li>Use 3-minute transition cues for smooth rotations.</li>
<li>Ranger 2 should actively circulate and cue students to stay on task.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: Color coding I Do (Green), We Do (Yellow), You Do (Blue) is for quick visual reference for rangers during facilitation and observation.</p>
