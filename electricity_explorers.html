<h1>Lesson Plan: Electricity Explorers – Observing Electricity in a System</h1>

<p>
<strong>Grade Level:</strong> Upper Elementary (4th–5th Grade)<br>
<strong>Duration:</strong> ~60 minutes<br>
<strong>Location:</strong> Classroom / Floyds Fork connection<br>
<strong>Instructors:</strong> Rangers (Erin & Lori)
</p>

<h2>Kentucky Science Standards Alignment</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Observe and describe how electricity behaves in systems and interacts with objects.</li>
  <li>Distinguish between conductors and insulators and how they affect energy flow.</li>
  <li>Use evidence to explain static vs. current electricity and relate electricity to natural phenomena like lightning.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Understand and observe electricity in simple systems using hands-on stations.</li>
  <li>Identify key concepts including <strong>static electricity, current electricity, conductors, insulators, attraction, repulsion, potential energy, and kinetic energy</strong>.</li>
  <li>Apply observation and reasoning to explain electricity in everyday contexts and connect it to natural phenomena at Floyds Fork.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Vocabulary</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Static Electricity</strong> – A buildup of electric charge on an object that doesn’t flow.</li>
  <li><strong>Current Electricity</strong> – Electric charge flowing through a circuit or path.</li>
  <li><strong>Conductor</strong> – A material that allows electricity to flow easily.</li>
  <li><strong>Insulator</strong> – A material that does not allow electricity to flow easily.</li>
  <li><strong>Attract</strong> – When objects pull toward each other due to electric charges.</li>
  <li><strong>Repel</strong> – When objects push away from each other due to electric charges.</li>
  <li><strong>Potential Energy</strong> – Stored energy that has the potential to do work.</li>
  <li><strong>Kinetic Energy</strong> – Energy of motion, energy in action.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Materials</h2>
<ul>
  <li>4 PVC pipes</li>
  <li>3 balloons</li>
  <li>2 beakers</li>
  <li>2 shallow containers</li>
  <li>String</li>
  <li>Salt and pepper</li>
  <li>Paper plates</li>
  <li>Empty soda can</li>
  <li>Rubber ball</li>
  <li>Pictures of lightning and other electricity examples from the park</li>
  <li>6 cotton or natural fiber towels</li>
  <li>Dry erase markers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Guided Discovery Questions for Rangers</h2>
<ul>
  <li>“Is this static or current electricity? How do you know?”</li>
  <li>“Are the objects attracting or repelling each other? Why?”</li>
  <li>“Which materials let electricity flow? Which block it?”</li>
  <li>“How does potential energy turn into kinetic energy in this station?”</li>
  <li>“How could electricity be seen in nature at Floyds Fork (lightning, charged surfaces)?”</li>
</ul>

    <strong>Station 1: Balloon Dance</strong><br>
    - Charge up balloons with cloth, observe attraction/repulsion.<br>
    - Questions: “Do balloons attract or repel? Static or current electricity?”<br><br>
    
    <strong>Station 2: Dancing Water</strong><br>
    - Hold charged PVC near water stream.<br>
    - Questions: “What happens to the water? Attract or repel? Static or current?”<br><br>
    
    <strong>Station 3: Salt & Pepper Separation</strong><br>
    - Hold charged balloon over mixture.<br>
    - Questions: “Which particles move? Why? Static or current?”<br><br>
    
    <strong>Station 4: Can & Ball</strong><br>
    - Move objects with charged PVC pipe.<br>
    - Questions: “Which moved and why? Attract or repel? Static or current?”<br><br>
    
    <strong>Station 5: Sticky Balloon</strong><br>
    - Test what surfaces the balloon sticks to.<br>
    - Questions: “Which surfaces attract? How does this relate to conductors/insulators?”<br>

  <td>
    Discuss: “What did you learn about electricity?” “Which stations did you enjoy?”<br>
    Emphasize connection to Floyds Fork and scientific method: observation, hypothesis, testing, recording results.<br>
    Ask students to explain examples of potential vs. kinetic energy in their stations.

<h2>Assessment / Look-Fors</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Participation:</strong> Students actively engage with stations and share observations.</li>
  <li><strong>Vocabulary Use:</strong> Correctly use terms like conductor, insulator, static electricity, current electricity, attract, repel, potential and kinetic energy.</li>
  <li><strong>Evidence-Based Reasoning:</strong> Students explain why objects move or attract using vocabulary.</li>
  <li><strong>Connections to Floyds Fork:</strong> Students relate electricity to natural examples like lightning or friction phenomena in the park.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Observation Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Ensure students understand the difference between static and current electricity.</li>
  <li>Check that students can identify attraction vs. repulsion and the role of materials (conductor vs insulator).</li>
  <li>Observe student engagement and ability to reason scientifically through each station.</li>
</ul>
