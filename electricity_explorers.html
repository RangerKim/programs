<h1>Lesson Plan: Electricity Explorers – Observing Electricity in a System</h1>

<p><strong>Grade Level:</strong> Upper Elementary<br>
<strong>Duration:</strong> ~60 minutes<br>
<strong>Location:</strong> Classroom / Floyds Fork connection<br>
<strong>Instructors:</strong> Rangers (Erin & Lori)</p>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Understand basic concepts of electricity (static vs. current) and identify conductors and insulators in everyday life and in Floyds Fork.</li>
  <li>Observe, predict, and analyze how electricity behaves through hands-on stations using the scientific method.</li>
  <li>Connect electricity phenomena to real-world examples in the park, such as lightning scars on trees and lightning rods, and relate observations to potential and kinetic energy.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Vocabulary</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Insulator</strong> – Material that does not allow electricity to flow easily (e.g., dry wood, rubber, plastic, cloth).</li>
  <li><strong>Conductor</strong> – Material that allows electricity to flow easily (e.g., metals, water, wet soil).</li>
  <li><strong>Static electricity</strong> – The buildup of electric charge on the surface of an object.</li>
  <li><strong>Current electricity</strong> – The flow of electric charge through a conductor.</li>
  <li><strong>Attract / Repel</strong> – Forces where objects are pulled together or pushed apart by electric charges.</li>
  <li><strong>Potential energy</strong> – Stored energy in a system (e.g., charged balloon).</li>
  <li><strong>Kinetic energy</strong> – Energy of motion (e.g., moving water, rolling can).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Materials</h2>
<ul>
<li>4 PVC pipes</li>
<li>3 balloons</li>
<li>2 beakers</li>
<li>2 shallow containers</li>
<li>String</li>
<li>Salt and pepper</li>
<li>Paper plates</li>
<li>Empty soda can and rubber ball</li>
<li>Pictures of lightning and lightning scars in the park</li>
<li>Cotton / natural fiber towels</li>
<li>Dry erase markers</li>
<li>Optional: photos of lightning rods in Woodland Gardens</li>
</ul>

<td>Student Arrival</td>
<td class="ido"><span class="label">I Do:</span> Greet and set expectations</td>
<td>Welcome students, take attendance, preview today’s hands-on electricity exploration. Make students feel excited. Prompt them to think: “What do you already know about electricity? What questions do you have?”</td>

<td>Introduction & Prior Knowledge Check</td>
<td class="wedo"><span class="label">We Do:</span> Discuss prior knowledge</td>
<td>Ask students what they already know about static vs. current electricity, conductors, and insulators. Record questions on chart paper. Encourage students to connect to experiences in the park (lightning, lightning rods, playground metal slides).</td>

<td>Vocabulary & Ranger Cheat Sheet</td>
<td class="ido"><span class="label">I Do:</span> Introduce key terms</td>
<td>Explain vocabulary: conductor, insulator, attract, repel, static vs. current, potential vs. kinetic. Show cheat sheet examples (metal wires, water, rubber, wood). Ranger models asking students: “Could this object carry electricity?” Highlight park examples: lightning scars, lightning rod on Woodland Gardens oak tree.</td>

<td>Demonstrate Electricity Concepts</td>
<td class="ido"><span class="label">I Do:</span> Model basic demonstrations</td>
<td>Ranger demonstrates static electricity using a balloon on hair or cloth. Show how objects attract or repel. Discuss whether energy is potential or kinetic. Explain that another ranger is setting up stations while this is demonstrated.</td>

<td>Station Rotation – Scientific Method Focus</td>
<td class="youdo"><span class="label">You Do:</span> Hands-on investigations</td>

<ul>
<li><strong>Station 1: Balloon Dance</strong> – Charge balloons with cloth, bring close together. Observe attract/repel. Record predictions, observations, and explanations. Connect to static electricity in the park (lightning buildup in clouds).</li>
<li><strong>Station 2: Dancing Water</strong> – Pour water slowly into a beaker. Hold charged PVC pipe near water. Observe bending. Record predictions, observations, and conclusions. Discuss potential vs. kinetic energy.</li>
<li><strong>Station 3: Salt & Pepper</strong> – Charge balloon, hold near mixture. Observe separation. Record results. Discuss why some particles are more attracted.</li>
<li><strong>Station 4: Can & Ball</strong> – Try to move can and ball using charged PVC pipe without touching. Record which objects moved and why. Discuss attraction/repulsion and static vs. current electricity.</li>
<li><strong>Station 5: Sticky Balloon</strong> – Test which objects the balloon sticks to. Record observations and connect to insulators/conductors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rangers circulate and guide students through the scientific method steps: <strong>Question → Hypothesis → Experiment → Observation → Conclusion</strong>. Ensure connections to park phenomena (lightning scars, lightning rods, water, metal objects).</p>

<td>Station Wrap-Up Discussion</td>
<td class="wedo"><span class="label">We Do:</span> Review findings</td>
<td>Ask students to share what they predicted vs. what they observed. Connect to real-world examples in Floyds Fork parklands. Reinforce vocabulary and scientific method steps. Highlight the oak tree in Woodland Gardens with a lightning rod and observed lightning scars on other trees in the park.</td>

<td>Reflection & Questions</td>
<td class="wedo"><span class="label">We Do:</span> Wrap up</td>
<td>Ask: “Which station surprised you? How does this relate to electricity in nature? Why do conductors and insulators matter in the park?” Reinforce key takeaways and connections to the scientific method.</td>

<h2>Ranger Tips / Actionable Suggestions</h2>
<ul>
<li>One ranger can model concepts and demonstrations while the second ranger sets up stations for smooth transitions.</li>
<li>Use park examples constantly: lightning rods, lightning scars, water streams, metal objects.</li>
<li>Prompt students to always record <em>predictions → observations → conclusions</em> at stations to practice scientific thinking.</li>
<li>Keep vocabulary visible on chart paper for quick reference: conductor, insulator, static electricity, current electricity, attract, repel, potential/kinetic energy.</li>
<li>Encourage students to connect stations to everyday experiences in the park: rolling can → rolling logs, balloon attraction → lightning, water bending → streams and river flow.</li>
<li>Color-coded I Do / We Do / You Do activities help rangers manage timing and transitions effectively.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Assessment / Look-Fors</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Participation:</strong> Students actively engage at each station and rotate safely.</li>
<li><strong>Vocabulary Understanding:</strong> Correctly identify conductors, insulators, static vs. current electricity.</li>
<li><strong>Scientific Method Skills:</strong> Students make predictions, observe outcomes, record data, and draw conclusions.</li>
<li><strong>Connections to Floyds Fork:</strong> Students relate electricity phenomena to lightning, water, metal, and park safety examples.</li>
<li><strong>Questioning & Thinking:</strong> Students ask thoughtful questions and reflect on observations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Observation Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Check that each station shows clear scientific method steps: Question → Hypothesis → Experiment → Observation → Conclusion.</li>
<li>Observe student engagement, reasoning, and ability to connect station activities to real-world examples in the park.</li>
<li>Ensure students are using correct vocabulary and explaining why objects attracted or repelled each other.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Color coding <span class="ido">I Do (Green)</span>, <span class="wedo">We Do (Yellow)</span>, <span class="youdo">You Do (Blue)</span> is for quick visual reference for the ranger during facilitation and observation.
