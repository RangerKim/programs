<h1>Lesson Plan: Electricity Explorers</h1>

<p><strong>Grade Level:</strong> Upper Elementary<br>
<strong>Duration:</strong> ~60 minutes<br>
<strong>Location:</strong> Classroom / Floyds Fork connection<br>
<strong>Instructors:</strong> Rangers (Erin & Lori)</p>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Observe and experiment with static and current electricity in simple systems.</li>
  <li>Use important vocabulary (insulator, conductor, attract, repel, potential vs kinetic energy) to explain electrical behavior.</li>
  <li>Apply the scientific method: ask questions, make predictions, test, observe, and draw conclusions, connecting to natural phenomena in Floyds Fork.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Vocabulary</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Insulator</strong> – A material that does not allow electricity to pass through easily (e.g., rubber, wood).</li>
  <li><strong>Conductor</strong> – A material that allows electricity to pass through easily (e.g., metal, water).</li>
  <li><strong>Static electricity</strong> – Electric charge that builds up on the surface of an object and can cause attraction or repulsion.</li>
  <li><strong>Current electricity</strong> – Flow of electric charge through a conductor, like in a battery or wire.</li>
  <li><strong>Attract</strong> – When two objects pull toward each other.</li>
  <li><strong>Repel</strong> – When two objects push away from each other.</li>
  <li><strong>Potential energy</strong> – Stored energy an object has due to position or charge.</li>
  <li><strong>Kinetic energy</strong> – Energy of motion.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Materials</h2>
<ul>
  <li>4 PVC pipes</li>
  <li>3 balloons</li>
  <li>2 beakers</li>
  <li>2 shallow containers</li>
  <li>String</li>
  <li>Salt & pepper mixture</li>
  <li>Paper plates</li>
  <li>Empty soda can</li>
  <li>Rubber ball</li>
  <li>Pictures of lightning and natural phenomena from Floyds Fork</li>
  <li>6 cotton/natural fiber towels</li>
  <li>Dry erase markers</li>
</ul>

<p>Students rotate through 5 stations, following the scientific method. Rangers circulate and support student inquiry.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Station 1 – Balloon Dance</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Question: What happens when two charged balloons are brought near each other?</li>
    <li>Hypothesis: Predict attraction, repulsion, or no movement.</li>
    <li>Experiment: Charge balloons with cloth, bring close/far, try near surfaces.</li>
    <li>Observe: Record what happens.</li>
    <li>Conclusion: Confirm if static electricity caused attraction or repulsion.</li>
    <li>Rangers: Guide observations, prompt discussion on static vs current electricity.</li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Station 2 – Dancing Water</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Question: How does a charged object affect a stream of water?</li>
    <li>Hypothesis: Predict water bending toward or away.</li>
    <li>Experiment: Slowly pour water into beaker, hold charged PVC near stream.</li>
    <li>Observe: Record water movement and direction.</li>
    <li>Conclusion: Identify static electricity in action.</li>
    <li>Rangers: Encourage students to explain results using vocabulary and energy concepts.</li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Station 3 – Salt & Pepper Separation</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Question: Can electricity separate tiny particles?</li>
    <li>Hypothesis: Predict which particles will move.</li>
    <li>Experiment: Mix salt & pepper, hold charged balloon nearby.</li>
    <li>Observe: Note which particles move more.</li>
    <li>Conclusion: Explain differences using conductors/insulators and static electricity.</li>
    <li>Rangers: Prompt discussion about why some particles respond differently.</li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Station 4 – Can & Ball Movement</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Question: Can a charged object make other objects move without touching?</li>
    <li>Hypothesis: Predict can or ball movement.</li>
    <li>Experiment: Charge PVC, bring near can/ball.</li>
    <li>Observe: Record which moved and direction.</li>
    <li>Conclusion: Identify attraction/repulsion and potential vs kinetic energy.</li>
    <li>Rangers: Facilitate reasoning, help students compare results to natural electric phenomena.</li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Station 5 – Sticky Balloon Challenge</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Question: What surfaces will a charged balloon stick to?</li>
    <li>Hypothesis: Predict which surfaces will attract.</li>
    <li>Experiment: Charge balloon, test on different surfaces.</li>
    <li>Observe: Record which surfaces stick.</li>
    <li>Conclusion: Explain using static electricity, insulators, and conductors.</li>
    <li>Rangers: Ask students to relate this to energy in nature, like lightning or charged clouds.</li>

<h2>Assessment / Look-Fors</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Participation:</strong> Students actively engage in stations and discussion.</li>
<li><strong>Scientific Method Understanding:</strong> Students ask questions, make hypotheses, observe, and draw conclusions.</li>
<li><strong>Vocabulary Use:</strong> Correctly use terms like insulator, conductor, static electricity, attract, repel.</li>
<li><strong>Observation Skills:</strong> Students notice and record effects of static electricity and energy transfer.</li>
<li><strong>Connections to Floyds Fork:</strong> Students link experiments to real-life electricity in nature.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Observation Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ensure students follow scientific method steps at each station.</li>
<li>Check that students can explain attraction/repulsion using vocabulary.</li>
<li>Observe curiosity, reasoning, and connection to natural phenomena in Floyds Fork.</li>
<li>Encourage students to test predictions and refine their hypotheses if needed.</li>
<li>Second ranger should be actively circulating and supporting students at stations while first ranger leads discussion.</li>
