<h1>Lesson Plan: Electricity Explorers</h1>

<p><strong>Grade Level:</strong> Upper Elementary<br>
<strong>Duration:</strong> ~60 minutes<br>
<strong>Location:</strong> Classroom / Floyds Fork connection<br>
<strong>Instructors:</strong> Rangers (Erin & Lori)</p>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<ul>
<li>Observe and experiment with static and current electricity in simple systems.</li>
<li>Use important vocabulary (insulator, conductor, attract, repel, potential vs kinetic energy) to explain electrical behavior.</li>
<li>Apply the scientific method: ask questions, make predictions, test, observe, and draw conclusions, connecting to natural phenomena in Floyds Fork.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Vocabulary</h2>
<ul>
<li>Insulator – A material that does not allow electricity to pass through easily (e.g., rubber, wood).</li>
<li>Conductor – A material that allows electricity to pass through easily (e.g., metal, water).</li>
<li>Static electricity – Electric charge that builds up on the surface of an object and can cause attraction or repulsion.</li>
<li>Current electricity – Flow of electric charge through a conductor, like in a battery or wire.</li>
<li>Attract – When two objects pull toward each other.</li>
<li>Repel – When two objects push away from each other.</li>
<li>Potential energy – Stored energy an object has due to position or charge.</li>
<li>Kinetic energy – Energy of motion.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Materials</h2>
<ul>
<li>4 PVC pipes</li>
<li>3 balloons</li>
<li>2 beakers</li>
<li>2 shallow containers</li>
<li>String</li>
<li>Salt & pepper mixture</li>
<li>Paper plates</li>
<li>Empty soda can</li>
<li>Rubber ball</li>
<li>Pictures of lightning and natural phenomena from Floyds Fork</li>
<li>6 cotton/natural fiber towels</li>
<li>Dry erase markers</li>
</ul>

<tr>
<td>~2</td>
<td>Student Arrival</td>
<td>I Do: Greet and set expectations</td>
<td>Welcome students warmly, take attendance, briefly preview the lesson. Make students excited about exploring electricity.<br>
Ranger 2 sets up stations while Ranger 1 introduces concepts.<br>
Cue students to put backpacks aside and assign station groups early.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>~3</td>
<td>Introduction to Electricity</td>
<td>I Do: Introduce concepts</td>
<td>Explain static vs current electricity, conductors vs insulators, attraction and repulsion. Show photos of lightning and natural examples from Floyds Fork.<br>
Ranger 2 continues station setup and checks that all materials are ready.<br>
Ask students: “Have you ever noticed your hair sticking up after sliding down a slide?” “What do you think causes lightning?”</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>~5</td>
<td>Vocabulary & Scientific Method Review</td>
<td>We Do: Guided discussion</td>
<td>Review key vocabulary and introduce the scientific method: Ask, Hypothesize, Experiment, Observe, Conclude.<br>
Ranger 2 ensures stations have instructions posted and materials organized.<br>
Prompt: “Let’s make a hypothesis about what might happen if we bring a balloon near water.”</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>~25</td>
<td>Electricity Stations</td>
<td>You Do: Student exploration</td>
<td>Students rotate through 5 stations, applying the scientific method at each:<br>
<ul>
<li><strong>Station 1 – Balloon Dance:</strong> Charge balloons with cloth. Predict what will happen when balloons come close together. Observe attraction/repulsion. Record results. Discuss static vs current electricity.</li>
<li><strong>Station 2 – Dancing Water:</strong> Pour water slowly into a beaker. Bring charged PVC near water without touching. Predict what will happen, observe, and record results. Discuss attraction/repulsion.</li>
<li><strong>Station 3 – Salt & Pepper:</strong> Hold charged balloon near salt & pepper mixture. Predict which particles will move. Observe and record results. Discuss why some particles respond more strongly.</li>
<li><strong>Station 4 – Can & Ball:</strong> Try to move a soda can and rubber ball with charged PVC pipe. Predict which moves first. Observe and record. Discuss potential vs kinetic energy.</li>
<li><strong>Station 5 – Sticky Balloon Challenge:</strong> Test which surfaces the charged balloon sticks to. Predict and record results. Discuss insulators vs conductors and static electricity.</li>
</ul>
Rangers circulate to prompt thinking: “Why did this happen?” “Which type of electricity is this?” “Can you connect this to nature?” Signal 3-minute warnings for smooth transitions.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>~10</td>
<td>Wrap-Up Discussion</td>
<td>We Do: Reflection & connection</td>
<td>Review observations and favorite stations. Discuss how students applied the scientific method.<br>
Ask: “Which experiment surprised you?” “How is this similar to what happens in nature at Floyds Fork?”<br>
Ranger 2 supports students in connecting observations to real-world examples of energy in nature.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>~5</td>
<td>Clean-Up & Questions</td>
<td>You Do: Student reflection</td>
<td>Guide clean-up of stations. Ask: “If you were a scientist, what experiment would you try next?” Praise curiosity and scientific reasoning. Reset stations for the next group.</td>
</tr>

<h2>Assessment / Look-Fors</h2>
<ul>
<li>Participation: Students actively engage in stations and discussions.</li>
<li>Scientific Method Understanding: Students ask questions, make hypotheses, observe, and draw conclusions.</li>
<li>Vocabulary Use: Correctly use terms like insulator, conductor, static electricity, attract, repel, potential and kinetic energy.</li>
<li>Observation Skills: Students notice and record effects of static electricity and energy transfer.</li>
<li>Connections to Floyds Fork: Students link experiments to natural phenomena in the park.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Observation Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Check that each activity clearly follows the scientific method steps.</li>
<li>Prompt students to explain attraction/repulsion using vocabulary.</li>
<li>Observe curiosity, reasoning, and connection to nature.</li>
<li>Use 3-minute transition cues for smooth station rotations.</li>
<li>Ranger 2 should actively circulate, assist, and cue students to stay on task.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: Color coding I Do (Green), We Do (Yellow), You Do (Blue) is for quick visual reference for rangers during facilitation and observation.</p>
